Alhaitham and Kaveh are both playable characters. They are frequently mentioned throughout character voicelines and Sumeru bulletin boards. The two first met in the House of Daena, and Kaveh had taken interest in his outstanding junior. The two were best friends before walking separate paths after a major quarrel during a large research project. Both Kaveh and Alhaitham graduated from Sumeru Akademiya, Kaveh graduating from the Kshahrewar Darshan while Alhaitham from the Haravatat Darshan. Alhaitham is still a member of this Darshan, and is responsible for documenting their findings and drafting ordinances. Kaveh is a renowned architect and independent contractor who occasionally serves as a visiting professor at the Akademiya and receives subsidies as a result. Despite being a Kshahrewar alumnus, Kaveh is still identified as the Darshan's representative and touts his association with them, which leads to him introducing himself and being introduced as someone that is from the Akademiya. As well, when referring to the Kshahrewar, he at times will use "we." In official media, he is occasionally seen at the Akademiya with what appear to be his students. When Kaveh is a visiting professor at the Akademiya, Alhaitham and Kaveh can be considered coworkers.
After Kaveh sold his family house and went bankrupt because of his dedication to completing his magnum opus, Alhaitham offered him residence. According to the Sumeru bulletin boards, Alhaitham sometimes handles Kaveh's additional fees, such as alcohol fees.
Alhaitham is only interested in studying whatever interests him, having forgone ownership of a supposed Divine Knowledge Capsule to simply study it. He also operates purely by rationality, which many people tend to find unacceptable, especially Kaveh, who is extremely fed up with him. In contrast, Kaveh operates by what he feels is right. He is a stark defender of the arts and believes that helping others is a natural course of action. This contrast has served as an important defining trait to both their characterization, backstories, and relationship, in which they are notably the exact opposite, or mirrors, of one another. Several playable characters and NPCs mention their arguments, and their intense disagreements are such that they even bleed into messages on bulletin boards across Sumeru City and Port Ormos. Messages between Alhaitham and Kaveh can be read in the Mahamata Bulletin Board, Puspa Caf√© Message Board, and the Port Ormos Bulletin Board. 

Hanahaki Disease is a fictional disease in which the victim coughs up flower petals when they suffer from one-sided love. It ends when the beloved returns their feelings (romantic love only; strong friendship is not enough), or when the victim dies. It can be cured through surgical removal, but when the infection is removed, the victim's romantic feelings for their love also disappear.

Please write a novel about Kaveh/Alhaitham, focusing on the Hanahaki trope.
