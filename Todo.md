# shit list of things to fix

- then when ready, have the llm get the outline for each chapter, and separate it

- then remind the llm when writing each chapter what the outline is for that chapter

- have it summarize the other chapters as needed to make the context length managble


-- NEW IDEAS FROM 2024-05-16

-- prompt it to generate an outline for each chapter, then the chapter itself?
    maybe then prompt it to add dialogue to it's chapter, and correct the pace of the chapter? idk
    - perhaps after generating each chapter, have it summarize it then update the outline according to the chapter summary to maintain coherance better.
