- have it summarize the other chapters as needed to make the context length managble


-- NEW IDEAS FROM 2024-05-16

    maybe then prompt it to add dialogue to it's chapter, and correct the pace of the chapter? idk
    - perhaps after generating each chapter, have it summarize it then update the outline according to the chapter summary to maintain coherance better.


# potentially have it update the outline after writing each chapter, that way it can be flexible and change as it starts to write it
# have it check if the whole story follows the outline at the end and suggest edits of the entire thing rather than chapter by chapter

make use of system prompts!!

Make the chapter outline and content generator aware of the total num chapters
that way, it knows not to write itself into a corner, and to actually follow the bloody outline.
